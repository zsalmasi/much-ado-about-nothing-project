# much-ado-about-nothing-project
The project focuses on analysing the texts of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing
The purpose is to present here texts of Much Ado About Nothing, such as the quarto text, the Folio and variants suited for  various analysis. Also I have pasted here the python script (statanalysi.py)that analyses the txt.
The texts that you can find here are:
maanqnohyphen.txt is a the quarto edition but I have deleted the hyphens at the end of the lines and united the two halves of the words and placed them in either the line where the first halv was originally or in the next line.
